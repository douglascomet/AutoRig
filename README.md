My auto rig that generates a bipedal rig with optional accessories. The auto rig has presets for characters that were used through out the "Hollowed" capstone project at FIEA

The demo above shows how it works. The function to call is autoRig.transUI()

It uses the Qt.py framework so it can work with PySide and PySide2: https://github.com/mottosso/Qt.py
